# 🎬 Movie Popularity Prediction  
### Pattern Recognition Project 2026 | Team CS_1

A machine learning project focused on predicting movie popularity using both **Regression** and **Multiclass Classification** techniques.  
The project explores how movie metadata such as genres, production companies, release dates, vote counts, and financial information influence audience popularity.

Built as part of the **Pattern Recognition / Machine Learning Projects 2026** coursework.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is divided into two milestones:

### 📈 Milestone 1 → Regression
Predict the continuous numerical value of movie popularity.

### 🎯 Milestone 2 → Classification
Classify movies into one of four popularity categories:

- Very Low
- Low
- Medium
- High

## 🧠 Main Objectives

- Build a complete ML pipeline from raw data to prediction
- Apply preprocessing and feature engineering techniques
- Experiment with multiple regression and classification models
- Perform feature selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluate models using proper metrics and visualizations
- Save trained models and preprocessing steps for unseen test datasets

---

# 📂 Dataset Features

The dataset contains movie metadata such as:

- Genres
- Production Companies
- Production Countries
- Spoken Languages
- Budget
- Revenue
- Vote Count
- Release Date
- Overview
- Posters / Backdrops / Homepage
- Adult Flag
- Runtime-related metadata
- Titles & Original Titles

# ⚙️ Preprocessing Pipeline

The preprocessing stage was designed to transform noisy real-world movie metadata into a clean machine-learning-ready dataset.

## 🔹 Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicate rows
- Removed rows with missing target values

## 🔹 Feature Engineering
Created additional informative features such as:

- `is_title_changed`
- `title_length`
- `overview_length`
- `has_backdrop`
- `has_homepage`
- `has_poster`
- `has_tagline`

## 🔹 Temporal Feature Extraction
Extracted:
- `release_day`
- `release_month`
- `release_year`

from the original release date.

## 🔹 Multi-label Handling
Processed:
- genres
- production companies
- countries
- languages

by extracting:
- first category
- number of categories

## 🔹 Missing Values Handling
- Numerical → Mean Imputation
- Categorical → Mode Imputation

## 🔹 Skewness Correction
Applied `log1p()` transformation on:
- budget
- revenue
- vote_count

## 🔹 Frequency Encoding
Encoded high-cardinality categorical features using frequency encoding.

## 🔹 Outlier Treatment
Applied Winsorization using:
- 1st percentile
- 99th percentile

## 🔹 Feature Scaling
Applied:
- Z-score Standardization

## 🔹 Feature Selection
Used:
- `SelectKBest(f_regression)` for Regression
- `SelectKBest(f_classif)` for Classification

# 🔍 Key Insights

🧠 Initial assumptions suggested that movie budget alone determines popularity.

📊 The analysis revealed that:
- vote count
- release year
- audience engagement
- metadata categories

have stronger predictive power than financial information alone.

The project demonstrated that movie popularity is a complex nonlinear problem best handled using ensemble learning techniques.

# 🌟 Final Conclusion

This project successfully built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline capable of handling real-world movie metadata for both regression and classification tasks.

The final tuned ensemble models achieved strong generalization performance while maintaining efficient preprocessing and scalable deployment through saved preprocessing pipelines and serialized models.

The dataset turned out to be less about “big budget = big popularity” and more like a cinematic ecosystem where timing, audience engagement, and metadata quietly pull strings behind the curtain 🎥✨
